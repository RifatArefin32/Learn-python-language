# A module in Python is a file that contains Python code, including functions, classes, and variables. 
# It allows us to organize our code logically, making it easier to manage and reuse. 
# Modules can include code that we've written, as well as code from external sources or the Python Standard Library.
# 
# Why Use Modules?
# - Organization: Modules help you break down a large codebase into smaller, manageable components.
# - Reusability: You can write code once and reuse it across multiple projects or scripts.
# - Namespace: Modules provide a separate namespace to avoid naming conflicts.
